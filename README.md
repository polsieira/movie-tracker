# Movie Tracker

A group project during Module 3 of Turing School of Software Design. Welcome to Movie Tracker where you will be building out an application that allows a user to sign in, see the latest movies, and favorite them for later. As a result of building out this project, you are going to be developing some muscle memory building out applications with Redux. You will also be getting much more practice doing network requests with a backend.
