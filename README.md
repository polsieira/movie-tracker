# Movie Tracker

A group project during Module 3 of Turing School of Software Design. Welcome to Movie Tracker where you will be building out an application that allows a user to sign in, see the latest movies, and favorite them for later. As a result of building out this project, you are going to be developing some muscle memory building out applications with Redux. You will also be getting much more practice doing network requests with a backend. Learning goals are:

1. Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
2. Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
3. Become comfortable with different network requests like GET, POST, & DELETE.
4. Solidify concepts with React to create clean and re-useable components.
5. Become comfortable with Reduxâ€™s lifecycle, creating actions, reducers, and connecting them to React components.
6. Understand and solidify concepts with React component, asynchronous code, and Redux testing.
